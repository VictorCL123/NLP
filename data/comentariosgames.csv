2,saw this on my timeline so I posted here please don't dm me
3,Could we see this armour make an appearance in infinite?
4,I mean. You can play the Anniversary 360 edition on Xbone and series x or play the master chief collection for it.
5,Happy birthday to the game that started it all!
6,Happy birthday to the first shooter I ever played nothing but good memories...besides the scary golden elite with the energy sword 
7,"Hey, wanna play The Library and Two Betrayals on Legendary Again?"
8,Doesn’t get more OG then this how many people have one of these!
9,Recently finished it for the first time in my life. Loved every moment
10,Reading the fall of reach to my kiddo after I read the offical spartan field manual. It's an awesome experience.
11,"Bad game, don't buy."
12,"Why do I even play #FUTChampions ? This game is not fun. Was at 11 wins with 10 to go, now I'm 12-17 and I had zero fun playing sweaty matchups with glitch and bad game play."
13,Kevin Harlan is having a bad game for an announcer and it's only the first quarter #DENvsLV #NFLonCBS
14,This is why I'm glad that I chose to be an observer of a crackling ember in this place. 
15,"MARVEL Duel is now available for players in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore! "
16,Not sure who needs to hear this but actively rooting for a player from your club to have a bad game just to prove a point is pure garbage.
17,I really don’t understand how his fans can talk about Ronaldo having a bad game for Portugal.
18,You make so much money during lightning rounds but can't manage to add more fucking servers every where so everyone can have good game play.
19,fake gamer girls
20,"""I've never heard of them"" this is re: a real experience"
21,I only play FIFA. FIFA is the only good game out there.
22,No need to insult the game or it creators if you don't like it don't play it don't make newbies or we old players start to hate this game.
23,", fifa 20 isn’t a good game to play, but to watch it during the fut champs cup"
24,I’m gonna play some fifa career mode
25,Good game but since I only get an hour or two after work to play
26,It’s unbelievable to me how INFERIOR your guys’ game is to every other game that I play. 
27,I try my hardest to think of good things to say about FIFA and I struggle to find anything
28,We have a Content Update going out momentarily for a new event: UEFA Champions League Group Stage!
29,If I wanted to play a laggy piece of shit game I'd go and play Gears 2. Lift your game Bad Company 2
30,Also here’s a character from MGS 3 who breathes through his skin for the same reason Quiet does
31,Dude was a plant that absorbed sunlight with the gears he was wearing and he was still able to breathe and eat
32,ts been a tough year for Gordon. Bad advice from his agent. The team had to switch gears with his hold out. 
33,"The state gears is in sucks really fucking bad I love gears it's my passion, but it's not fun I cannot play the game solo or in a group it just always a stressful game and boring no matter"
34,Yoo start to play gears... Its a real good game breh! Lol
35,"We know you are super keen to play the Tech Test, but the plus side is this is what it's for and you are helping us make a better game."
36,If you guys stop playing it then they will be force to put out a good game.
37,Gears 2 and 3 were the days when you could just play a good game and not have to worry about life
38,I couldn't care less what resolution Gears 4 or Wild end up at. All I want is a good game that is fun to play and has solid gameplay
39,I play both games. But I still get more kick and enjoyment out if gears especially when I have a good game :) and people to play with.
40,Not normally my kind of thing (aside from XCom) but Gears Tactics is actually a very good game and the graphics are mint. Here's a little snap from my first mission play though.
